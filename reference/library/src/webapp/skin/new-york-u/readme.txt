-- New York University Sakai Skin v1 --
This is the skin for the Sakai CLE pilot "NYU Classes" based on default skin of Sakai CLE 2.8.1.


-- IMPORTANT --
The CSS files are generated using the SASS preprocessor and the compass framework. Please make changes to the .scss files in the sass folder and not the css files themselves. The css will then files will need to be regenerated. If don't have SASS installed, please check in your changes to the scss files to MSub and contact a maintainer below to regenerate the css files.

If you do have compass installed you can use CLI: 
compass compile --force 

Alternatively, the maven build process will generate the source files for you.

Please do NOT check in the generated .css files into MSub -- we would like to direct all developers to modify the .scss source files.

Please do NOT check in the .sass-cache folder into MSub.
